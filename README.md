Citi Bikes for Data for June 2020

Homework Description
For this challenge, I wanted analysis the to show the citi bike data for a month in the summer of the 2020 pandemic. For June 2020, I was trying to display based on the data provided in 2020 what the most popular times that bikes were used, the most popular bike start stations and end stations, the average duration of a trip based on birth date, the number of trips based on birth rate, and then show similar metrics based on gender.

Phenomenons:

1. The popular time to use a Citi bike in June 2020 was around 5 PM. Which is around rush hour for most 9 to 5 workers. It made me realize that a lot of people may have been working during the pandemic in 2020 summer.

 

2.  The most popular start and end station by number of trips was "12 Ave and W 40 St". There were a lot of the same start stations and end station that were most popular at the same locations. Probably because these areas are highly populated and have a lot of foot traffic.

 
3. I was very surprised that the most popular birth year for the highest number of trips in June 2020 was for persons born in 1969. When I started looking at the age data, I became skeptical of the accuracy. If you are born in 1969 you would be around 51 years old which seems odd to be the most frequent user of bikes during this time. 
 


4.  I was also surprised that the trip duration was pretty commonly distribution from 1880 birth year to the 2000s birth years. This made me think people were entering erroneous information for their birth year. 1880 would mean that people were 140 years old. Maybe it was an error and people really meant to put 1980s instead. You would think the system wouldn't allow the person to put anything before 1900.
 








5. I analyzed the given gender for each trip and found out that males are the most frequent to use bikes in June of 2020. They took over one million trips. Men also had the longest average duration of the sexes. Men we also the most common subscriber of the sexes.
